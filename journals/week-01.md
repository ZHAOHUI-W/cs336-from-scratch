# Week 1 journal

## Day 1 — Map A1 (2026-09-16)

### What I built
- No implementation yet (map day only).
- Oriented on Assignment 1 deliverables and the `tests/adapters.py` contract.

### Design decisions (link ADRs)
- None yet. Day 2 starts ADR `001-adamw-state-layout`.

### What I locked in
**A1 end-to-end pipeline**
1. Train BPE tokenizer (bytes → merges → vocab)
2. Encode text → integer token IDs
3. Transformer LM predicts next-token distribution
4. Cross-entropy loss + AdamW updates
5. Sample / evaluate perplexity (TinyStories)

**`adapters.py` as interface**
`adapters.py` is a thin facade: tests own the weights and shapes; my code owns the algorithms behind stable function signatures (`run_*` / `get_*`). I implement real modules in `cs336_basics/` and wire them through adapters.

**Week 1 vs Week 2 adapters**
- Week 1: `get_adamw_cls`, `get_tokenizer`, `run_train_bpe`, loss/schedule/checkpoint/batch helpers
- Week 2: linear, embedding, RMSNorm, SwiGLU, RoPE, attention, transformer block/LM

**Tokenizer reminder**
UTF-8 bytes → BPE merges → token IDs; encode/decode must round-trip; special tokens stay unsplit.

**Loss reminder**
Next-token CE $-\log p(\text{correct})$; uniform over vocab $V$ → $\log V$.

### Bugs that taught me something
- N/A (no coding day).

### Architecture takeaway
Interfaces (`adapters.py`) are part of the design — they freeze what must stay stable while internals can change.

### Next week’s risk / tomorrow
Day 2: draft ADR 001 (AdamW state layout + decoupled weight decay), then implement AdamW and match `torch.optim.AdamW` on a toy step.
